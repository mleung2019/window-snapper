# Window Snapper

This Cinnamon extension allows you to snap a focused window into place with keybindings. Heavily inspired by rxhanson's [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle/). You can also modify the default keybindings to fit your needs in the extension's settings menu!

You can snap a window to:

1. Left half
2. Right half
3. Top left quarter
4. Top right quarter
5. Bottom left quarter
6. Bottom right quarter
7. Left third
8. Middle third
9. Right third
10. Left two thirds
11. Right two thirds

## Installation

Open the Terminal app and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/mleung2019/window-snapper.git ~/.local/share/cinnamon/extensions/window-snapper@mleung2019
```

## Credits

Keybinding code was borrowed from klangman's [Adjacent Windows](https://github.com/klangman/Adjacent-Windows).

Code used to determine the dimensions of the screen (excluding panels) was borrowed from shuairan's [gTile](https://github.com/shuairan/gTile).
